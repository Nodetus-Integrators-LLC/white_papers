These should be closely aligned with what the user needs to achieve. |
|  |  |  | Performance Metrics: Set specific, measurable standards for evaluating how well the GPT meets its objectives. These could include metrics like accuracy, response time, and the relevance of provided information. |
|  |  |  | Scope of Knowledge: Clearly outline the areas of knowledge the GPT needs to cover, ensuring it has the necessary depth and breadth to handle the tasks at hand. This includes defining any limitations to prevent the GPT from attempting to handle queries outside its scope. |
| 4. Specify Data and Validation Requirements for GPT | (Optional) Clearly define the type and format of data needed, including any necessary data sources, data ranges, and specific metrics. Establish criteria for validating the information to ensure accuracy and relevance. If you want to source outside of credible areas and broaden by reducing accuracy, you can remove accuracy criteria. | Request “validated quantitative data within the last 2 years, segmented by region and industry. Ensure data sources are from verified market research firms or official government publications.” | Type and Format: Specifying that the data should be quantitative and recent ensures relevance and utility for decision-making. |
|  |  |  | Data Sources: Stating that data should come from verified sources enhances credibility. |
|  |  |  | Validation Criteria: Setting criteria for data validation helps in filtering out unreliable or irrelevant information, ensuring the AI focuses on high-quality inputs. |
| 5. Incorporate Data Best Practices | (Optional) Specify the types of data needed according to various classifications such as dependency, order, continuity, level of measurement, source, and variability. Establish validation protocols based on these characteristics. | Request “current employment rates (a dependent, continuous variable) from official national statistics, segmented by industry (a nominal variable) and region. Compare these with independent GDP growth rates (a continuous variable), using data from the past two years to forecast employment trends (a dynamic, stochastic model).” | Dependency: Understanding whether data is independent or dependent shapes the analysis. |
|  |  |  | Order and Continuity: Clarifies whether data should be treated as continuous/discrete or ordered/unordered. |
|  |  |  | Level of Measurement: Specifies whether data should be nominal, ordinal, etc. |
|  |  |  | Source: Empirical (from observations) vs. theoretical (from models). |
|  |  |  | Variability: Whether the context requires deterministic or probabilistic approaches. |
|  |  |  | Dynamics: Whether static (point in time) or dynamic (changing over time) data is needed. |
| 6. Incorporate Governance for Clarity, Language, and Ethical Standards | Apply a set of principles across all prompt designs to ensure not only clarity and effective communication but also ethical compliance and transparency. | Use clear language and ensure responses consider user data privacy and AI transparency. | Clarity and Language: Ensure the prompt is concise and devoid of unnecessary jargon to prevent misinterpretation and improve response accuracy. |
