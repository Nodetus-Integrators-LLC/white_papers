# Agile Acquisition White Papers

## Overview
The **Agile Acquisition** folder contains white papers focused on innovative approaches to government and federal procurement. These documents are designed to promote agile methodologies in acquisition, providing flexible, responsive, and efficient solutions tailored to modern procurement needs. By leveraging agile frameworks, these white papers aim to facilitate more effective sourcing, particularly for modular, segmented, and scalable projects.

## Purpose
Agile acquisition white papers address the limitations of traditional, monolithic procurement models, particularly when engaging with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and other small enterprises. These papers provide frameworks that support streamlined, simplified acquisition methods, with an emphasis on inclusivity and equitable access to federal contracts.

## Key Objectives
The white papers in this folder are intended to:
- **Promote Agile and Modular Procurement**: Outline methods for segmenting larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks that can be executed in an agile environment.
- **Encourage Simplified Acquisition Processes**: Emphasize the use of simplified acquisition thresholds (SAT) to reduce administrative burden and increase procurement efficiency.
- **Support Small and Disadvantaged Businesses**: Develop models that provide exclusive access to SDBs and businesses with <$1 million in annual revenue, enhancing diversity and inclusivity in government contracts.
- **Establish Program Management Oversight**: Integrate Program Management Companies (PMCs) to ensure quality, compliance, and accountability throughout the procurement process.

## White Papers Available
### 1. [Modular Microbusiness Sourcing using Simplified Agile Acquisition](./agile-acquisition/modularMicroSourcing)
This white paper proposes a dedicated SAT-exclusive portal for SDBs, with a focus on agile, inclusive procurement. It includes PMC oversight to help ensure project success, segmented bidding processes, and capped FTE limitations per contract bid to support quality and manageable workloads.

### 2. [Polymorphic Procurement](./agile-acquisition/polymorphic-procurements)
Polymorphic Procurement focuses on flexible, adaptive contracting structures that promote vendor accountability, enable fleixble language, empowering Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to shape rewards/penalties and allow for modular contracting.
#### a. [FLINDER- Functional Line-Item Non-Delivery Rebates](./agile-acquisition/polymorphic-procurements/FLINDR)
- FLINDR itemizes line items and functional areas that are mandatory needs, that if infringed or misrepresented can mean fiscal penalties to vendors who misrepresent their products.

## How to Use These White Papers
These white papers serve as both strategic guides and practical frameworks for agencies seeking to adopt agile procurement models. They provide actionable insights and structured processes that agencies and businesses can use to:
- Utilizing modular and non-typical acquisition strategies to empower small businesses
- Utilizing small, modular contracts to pivot with Statements of Objectives (SOOs) to quickly iterate toward organizational mission objectives
- Thinking of new ways to ensure contracts control vendor accountability when bidding projects

By following these frameworks, users can support more efficient, responsive government procurement while promoting inclusivity and innovation.
