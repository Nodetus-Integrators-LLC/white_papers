| **Core Architecture**        | Understand the model's foundational structure and any enhancements made over standard LLM architectures.                                                                   | "Can you describe the core model architecture?"                                                                                                                      |
| **Customization & Training** | Evaluate the extent of domain-specific fine-tuning or additional data used to enhance the model's performance in specialized areas.                                         | "What kind of domain-specific datasets were used?"                                                                                                                   |
| **API-Based or Local**       | Determine if the model operates via an external API, which affects latency, scalability, and security.                                                                     | "Can you function without an internet connection?"                                                                                                                   |
| **Training Process**         | Gain insight into the phases of training, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and continuous learning.                                                                     | "How many iterations were involved in your training?"                                                                                                                |
| **Domain-Specific Bias**     | Check for adaptability to domain-specific terminology and the model's ability to handle ambiguity and evolving contexts.                                                    | "Can you explain how you handle ambiguities in [specific domain]?"                                                                                                   |
| **Performance & Consistency**| Assess how the model performs under varying conditions, including high traffic and complex queries, and whether it maintains consistent output.                             | "What benchmarks or performance metrics do you use?"                                                                                                                 |
| **Security & Compliance**    | Ensure the model meets industry standards for data security and compliance, especially when handling sensitive information.                                                  | "What measures do you have to protect sensitive data?"                                                                                                               |
| **Integration**              | Evaluate how easily the model can be integrated into existing systems and workflows, considering API compatibility and security protocols.                                  | "How do you handle integration with existing systems?"                                                                                                               |
| **Cost Considerations**      | Understand the costs associated with the model, including licensing, scalability, and maintenance.                                                                          | "Are there specific licensing fees, and how do costs scale with usage?"                                                                                              |
| **Risk & Mitigation**        | Identify any potential risks or limitations with the model, such as reliance on external servers, ethical concerns, or data bias, and how these are mitigated by the vendor. | "Do you have safeguards against domain-specific biases, and how do you manage these?"                                                                                |
