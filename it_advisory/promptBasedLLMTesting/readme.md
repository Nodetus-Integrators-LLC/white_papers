## Overview
This playbook provides a set of strategic prompts to help acquisition teams understand the underlying characteristics of language models (LLMs). It aims to determine if the model is API-based, assess the extent of domain-specific training, and evaluate the model's foundational architecture. These prompts can be used during vendor demonstrations or early evaluations to inform acquisition decisions.

## Problem Statement
### Context:
Acquisition offices face challenges when evaluating AI models pitched by vendors. Companies frequently present solutions that claim to offer advanced capabilities, often built on top of existing large language models (LLMs). However, it can be difficult to determine how much of the solution is genuinely innovative versus a repackaging of pre-existing models. Understanding what is "under the hood" is essential to assess the true value of these solutions, ensure they meet the organization's requirements, and avoid paying premiums for minimal customization.

### Core Issues:
1. **Transparency**: Vendors may not clearly communicate the underlying architecture or the extent of customization applied to a pre-trained model.
2. **Cost Justification**: It is crucial to understand if the product justifies its price, especially if it relies on open-source or existing LLMs with minor adjustments.
3. **Performance and Integration**: Evaluating whether the pitched LLM solution will integrate seamlessly with existing systems and perform efficiently under expected workloads.
4. **Security and Compliance**: Ensuring that any external dependencies (such as API-based models) do not introduce vulnerabilities or compliance risks.

### Objective:
The goal is to develop a set of structured prompts that acquisition teams can use to evaluate the underlying architecture, training methodologies, and operational dependencies of LLM solutions. This will help ensure informed purchasing decisions, clear expectations on performance, and transparency in vendor claims.

## Understanding Core LLM Architecture
### Prompts:
1. *"Can you describe your core model architecture? Are you based on well-known models like GPT-3, GPT-4, or another type?"*
2. *"How do you differentiate yourself from base models like GPT-4? Can you highlight any key improvements?"*
3. *"Was your training conducted on general datasets, or did you include domain-specific data? If so, which domains?"*
4. *"Do you follow a transformer architecture, or is there a different underlying technology?"*

**Goal**: Gauge whether the model has a general-purpose or specialized architecture and understand if it's based on an existing model.

---

## 2. Identifying Customization and Domain Training
### Prompts:
1. *"How were you fine-tuned or customized for this specific application or use case?"*
2. *"What kind of domain-specific datasets were used to improve your performance in specialized tasks?"*
3. *"Can you provide an example of how you would handle queries specific to [insert domain, e.g., finance, healthcare, legal]?"*
4. *"If you were trained with additional data, was this process manual or automated?"*

**Goal**: Determine the extent of fine-tuning and customization for specific use cases, which can reveal whether the model has specialized domain knowledge.

---

## 3. Testing for API-Based or Local Models
### Prompts:
1. *"Can you function without an internet connection, or do you rely on external servers for processing?"*
2. *"Are there any performance differences when processing tasks locally versus through an API?"*
3. *"If multiple users access your services simultaneously, how do you manage the load?"*
4. *"Can you explain how you handle large amounts of data or concurrent requests?"*

**Goal**: Understand whether the model operates via an external API or locally, which can affect factors like latency, security, and scalability.

---

## 4. Assessing Training Process and Iteration
### Prompts:
1. *"How many iterations were involved in your training, and were there distinct phases like pre-training, fine-tuning, or domain adaptation?"*
2. *"Were any reinforcement learning or feedback loops involved in your development? Can you describe this process?"*
3. *"How do you handle continuous learning or updating to adapt to new information?"*
4. *"Can you provide insights on the scale of your training, such as the number of parameters?"*

**Goal**: Learn about the training phases and techniques, which can give insights into the modelâ€™s adaptability and improvement mechanisms.

---

## 5. Checking for Domain-Specific Bias and Adaptability
### Prompts:
1. *"Can you explain how you handle ambiguities or scenarios involving [insert specific domain]?"*
2. *"If presented with new and emerging terminology in a domain, how would you respond?"*
3. *"Can you give examples of cases where your training data might limit your ability to answer accurately?"*
4. *"Do you have any safeguards against domain-specific biases, and how do you manage these?"*

**Goal**: Evaluate how well the model handles specific domain knowledge, biases, and adaptability to emerging terms or contexts.

---

## 6. Assessing Performance and Consistency
### Prompts:
1. *"How do you ensure consistency in your responses when given similar questions at different times?"*
2. *"What benchmarks or performance metrics do you use to measure your accuracy and efficiency?"*
3. *"Can you explain how your performance might change under different loads, like high user traffic or complex queries?"*
4. *"How do you handle long-form content versus short, direct responses?"*

**Goal**: Check for performance consistency, which is essential for scalable applications and determining how the model handles varying types of input.

---

## 7. Understanding Security and Compliance
### Prompts:
1. *"What measures do you have in place to protect sensitive data that is processed or stored?"*
2. *"How do you ensure compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or other industry regulations?"*
3. *"Can you outline how data is handled and processed during interactions?"*
4. *"Are there any specific privacy controls that users can configure when using this model?"*

**Goal**: Ensure the model has appropriate security measures and complies with regulatory requirements, especially if handling sensitive data.

---

## 8. Summarizing Insights and Next Steps
### Prompts for Internal Use:
1. *"Based on responses, does the model demonstrate sufficient customization for our use case?"*
2. *"Is the model API-based, and if so, are there potential latency or security concerns we need to address?"*
3. *"Did the vendor provide clarity on the underlying architecture and any domain-specific adaptations?"*
4. *"Are there any identified risks or gaps that would require further investigation or testing?"*

**Goal**: Summarize findings to determine if further evaluation or adjustments are necessary. Use insights to inform acquisition decisions or contract negotiations.

## Conclusion
This prompt-based playbook is designed to be used directly by acquisition teams to test and evaluate the underlying characteristics of LLM models without relying on external tools. The structured questions should help reveal details about the model's architecture, customization, training processes, performance, and security to inform strategic decisions.

**Note**: Ensure that any testing aligns with ethical guidelines and respects the terms of use set by the model's provider.
