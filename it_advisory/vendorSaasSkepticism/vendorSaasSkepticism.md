# Objective
For 3rd Party SaaS Assessment and Benchmarking

Reduce government waste and minimize dissatisfaction with SaaS products by:
1. Providing better validation on proof-of-concepts and set a standard of in-depth acquisition guidelines.
2. Performing comprehensive audits on the security, compliance, and industry standards.
3. Quantifying benchmarks where qualitative information can be categorically measured as precisely as possible against another product.

Nodetus Integrators has developed a playbook and method for helping government agencies arrive at the best conclusion about software they are building or acquiring based on their requirements. From concept to minimal viable product, unit test to go-live production, nothing hurts projects at scale more than a lack of advocacy from business users within the technical space. This is an undervalued space in IT acquisition.

In a recent era where accelerated innovation and big risk technology are king—where exponential growth has been the commercial mantra—Nodetus believes that to counter the lack of accountability, we must provide impartial due diligence and proven hypothesis testing. This focus should be applied across all suites of technology, especially those used by the Government.

# Why?
## Use Case: SaaS Product Using Open-Source Text Editor Code
**Synopsis**: Company A uses an open-source text editor for their product, which hasn't been heavily utilized. Fast forward eight years, and the company has expanded with new features all using this old module. The text editor is outdated and cannot handle modern parameters.

**Issue**: The outdated editor results in high costs and unmet expectations due to lack of SLAs and best practices.

**Risk**: The SaaS product is unprepared, leading to contract issues and potential financial impact.

**Risk Mitigation**: Utilizing a third-party vendor specializing in word processors could have mitigated this risk.

**Legal**: Misrepresentation can lead to costly issues; SaaS products often develop "Vaporware-like" features to win business.

**Conclusion**: Effective validation, auditing, and benchmarking are essential for SaaS procurement.

# Lifecycle of SaaS Acquisition
The process usually involves:
1. Development by the product company.
2. Selling through a reseller.
3. Configuration by service providers.
4. Testing by QA teams.
5. Deployment and maintenance.

# SaaS Acquisition Lifecycle and Associated Anti-Patterns
Different stakeholders can introduce negative patterns:
- **Product Companies**: Often lack transparency, leading to poorly informed decisions.
- **Resellers**: Focus on sales volume without providing technical advice.
- **Dev Providers**: Over-engineer solutions or cut corners.
- **QA Providers**: Might overlook critical test cases.
- **O&M Providers**: Can be reactive, leading to frequent issues.

# Why Professional Skepticism?
Professional skepticism is crucial to:
- **Mitigate Risks**: Avoid failures by questioning assumptions.
- **Assure Quality**: Address bottlenecks and validate true product capabilities.
- **Enhance Cost Efficiency**: Deter unforeseen costs and misrepresented features.
- **Provide Legal Safeguards**: Reduce risks of legal repercussions due to false claims.
- **Improve User Satisfaction**: Ensure features match real-world needs.

# What Comes Next?
- **Adaptive Frameworks**: Implement real-time learnings and insights.
- **Intelligent Systems**: Use AI for initial product scrutiny.
- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Collaborate with mission-motivated private sector experts.
- **Transparency and Open Standards**: Promote open standards to minimize obfuscation.
- **Educational Programs**: Foster professional skepticism through ongoing training.

The degree of skepticism should increase based on the layers of separation from the root product. The formula provided calculates skepticism, taking into account shared layers developed by the same team.

Greater separation from the codebase requires heightened scrutiny. Transparency ensures accountability, crucial in sectors like federal procurement.
